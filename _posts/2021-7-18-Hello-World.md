Banks' balance sheet

Model of perfect comeptition
model setup
large number of identical banks compete for deposits and loans
perfect competition with deposit rate r_D  and loan rate r_L  taken as given
market supply of deposits D(r_D)   
market demand for loans L(r_L) 
interbank market where banks can borrow or lend at rate r which is set by central bank 
Assumptions
bank loans are riskless, no default
banks have no equity capital
no intermediation costs
Benchmark
Bank balance sheet: \\l = d+b 
Bank profits:  \\ \pi=lr_L-dr_D-br=\underbrace{l(r_L-r)}_{profits\ from\ lending}+\underbrace{d(r-r_D)}_{profits\ from\ deposit\ taking}  
Competitive equilibrium characterized by zero-profit conditions: \\ r_L=r\ and\ r_D=r 
Equilibrium deposits: \\ D(r_D) = D(r)  
Equilibrium loans: \\ L(r_L) = L(r)  
Reserve requirements \phi 
Bank balance sheet: \\l +\phi d=d+b  
Bank profits: \\ \pi=lr_L-dr_D-br +\phi d\bar{r}=\underbrace{ l(r_L-r)}_{profits\ from\ lending}+\underbrace{d[(1-\phi)r+\phi\bar{r}-r_D]}_{profits\ from\ deposits\ taking} 
Non-remunerated ( \bar{r}=0 ): \\r_L=r\ and\ r_D=(1-\phi)r 
Remunerated at the rate \bar{r}<r : \\r_L=r\ and\ r_D=(1-\phi)r+\phi \bar{r} 
Renumerated at the rate \bar{r}=r: \\r_L=r\ and\ r_D=r 
Capital requirements \gamma 
Bank balance sheet: \\l=d+b+k=d+b+\gamma l 
Shareholders requirement premium \delta>0 on equity
Bank profits: \\ \pi=lr_L-dr_D-br -\gamma l(r+\delta)=\underbrace{ l[r_L-(r+\gamma \delta)]}_{profits\ from\ lending}+\underbrace{d(r-r_D)}_{profits\ from\ deposits\ taking} 
competitive equilibrium: \\  r_L=r+\gamma\delta\ and\ r_D=r 
Fixed supply of capital K : 
\delta   is determined by \gamma L(r+\gamma\delta)=K 
bank lending is given by L = K/\gamma , independent of policy rate r 
Intermediation costs c(d,l) 
Bank balance sheet: \\ l=d+b 
Bank profits:\\ \pi = lr_L-dr_D-br-c(d,l) = l(r_L-r)+d(r-r_D)-c(d,l) 
Competitive equilibrium: \\ r_L-r=\frac{\partial c(d,l)}{\partial l}\ and\ r-r_D = \frac{\partial c(d,l)}{\partial d}\  
Interbank market freezes 
Market Power
Bank balance sheet: \\ l=d+b 
Local monopoly banks: \\ max_{r_L,r_D}[L(r_L)(r_L-r)+D(r_D)(r-r_D)]\to \\ FOC: \ \frac{r_L-r}{r_L}=\frac{1}{\epsilon_L}\ and\ \frac{r-r_D}{r_D}=\frac{1}{\epsilon_D} 
Cournot competition (work with inverse supply of deposits r_D(D) and inverse demand for loans r_L(L) : \\ max_{d_j,l_j}[l_j(r_L(l_j+\sum_{i\neq j}l_i)-r)+d_j(r-r_D(d_j+\sum_{i\neq j}d_i))]\to \\  FOC:\ r_L(L)-r+l_jr_L^{\prime}(L)=0\ and\ r-r_D(D)-d_jr_D^{\prime}(D)=0\\ Symmetric\ eq.:\ r_L(L)-r = \frac{Lr_L^{\prime}(L)}{n}\ and\ r-r_D(D)= \frac{Dr_D^{\prime}(D)}{n} 
Cournot competition with no interbank market
Bertrand competition (work with supply of deposits D(r_D) and demand for loans L(r_L) ): \\ r_L =r\ and\ r_D = r 
Monopolistic competition (Circular road model/Salop model): Competition in deposit market where banks invest in an asset that pays an exogenous return r, depositors travelling to bank (located on circumference of unit length) involves travel\ cost\ \mu per unit of distance.\\ Intermediation\ margin:\ r-r_D = \frac{\mu}{n}\\ Equilibrium\ bank\ profits:\ \pi(n)=\frac{1}{n}(r-r_D)=\frac{\mu}{n^2} 
Bank Profitability
Cournot competition for loans and deposits among n banks
Linear inverse demand for loans \\ r_L(L)=a-bL 
Linear inverse supply of deposits \\ r_D(D) = c+eD 
Interbank market where banks borrow and lend at r 
Fixed amount k of equity capital per bank
Bank j balance sheet \\l_j=d_j+b_j+k 
Bank j profits \\ \pi_j = l_jr_L-d_jr_D-b_jr=\underbrace{l_j(r_L-r)}_{profits from lending}+\underbrace{d_j(r-r_D)}_{profits from deposit taking}+kr 
Loan market equilibrium \\max_{l_j}[(a-bL-r)l_j]\\ FOC:\ a-bL-r-bl_j=0\\ symmetric\ eq.:\ L=\frac{n}{n+1}\frac{a-r}{b}\ and\ r_L=\frac{a+nr}{1+n}\\ Loan\ market\ margin:\ r_L-r= \frac{a-r}{1+n}\\ Profts\ from\ lending:\ \pi_L=(r_L-r)\frac{L}{n}\\ r \uparrow \to  \pi_L \downarrow\ and\ n \uparrow \to \pi_L \downarrow  
Deposit market equilibrium \\ deposit\ market\ margin:\ r-r_D=\frac{r-c}{1+n}\\ profits\ from\ deposit\ taking:\ \pi_D=(r-r_D)\frac{D}{n}\\ r \uparrow \to  \pi_D \uparrow\ and\ n \uparrow \to \pi_D \downarrow 
 \\ r \downarrow \\ \Rightarrow r_L \downarrow, r_D \downarrow\\ \Rightarrow r_L-r \uparrow, r-r_D \downarrow \\ \Rightarrow \pi_L \uparrow, \pi_D \downarrow \\ \Rightarrow \pi = \pi_L+\pi_D+kr ?  
Returen on Equity (ROE) \\ROE = \frac{\pi}{k} = \frac{\pi_L+\pi_D}{k}+r  
Market value of bank and price-to-book ratio\\ \nu = \frac{\pi+k}{1+r+\delta}=\frac{1+ROE}{1+r+\delta}k\\  \frac{\nu}{k}=\frac{1+ROE}{1+r+\delta}  \\  \nu = \pi(\frac{1}{1+r+\delta}+\frac{1}{(1+r+\delta)^2}+...)=\frac{\pi}{r+\delta} = \frac{ROE}{r+\delta} k\\ \frac{\nu}{k} = \frac{ROE}{r+\delta} 
Introducing capital requirement k_j \geq \gamma l_j  : two possible cases if the constraint is binding
banks choose not to raise equity \to L=nk/\gamma 
banks choose to raise equity, in which case initial shareholders have to pay new shareholders \delta(\gamma l_j-k) 
Loan market equilibrium \\ max_{l_j} [(a-bL-r)l_j - \delta max \{\gamma l_j-k,0\}]
